## Installing Actian.EFCore

### Before installing

Actian.EFCore 9.0 relies on Actian.Client (Actian .NET Data Provider) version 8.0.6 and above to work. Actian.Client has not been published to [NuGet.org], so it will have to be added to a local or private NuGet feed, which the project has access to.

Actian.Client (Actian .NET Data Provider) can be downloaded from [Customer Downloads Provider].

For help setting up a local NuGet feed see: [Setting up Local NuGet Feeds | Microsoft Docs].

### Install using the .NET Core CLI

```
dotnet add package Actian.EFCore
```

### Install using the NuGet Package Manager Console in Visual Studio

```powershell
Install-Package Actian.EFCore
```

## Testing

The Actian.EFCore solution contains a number of automated tests.

### Configuration for tests

When running tests the database server to be used is specified by the environment variable `ACTIAN_TEST_CONNECTION_STRING`. This variable should contain an Actian client connection string specifying:

- The actian server
- The port
- The dabase user id
- The password for the dabase user id
- Persist Security Info=true

Example:
```
Server=actian-client-test;Port=II7;User ID=efcore_test;Password=xxxxxxxxxx;Persist Security Info=true
```

The connection string should _not_ specify the database.

The database user specified in the connection string should:
- have permission to create new database users
- have permission to impersonate other database users

### Preparing to test

A number of databases, owned by the `"dbo"` user, need to be created before running tests.

These databases can be created on the machine that hosts the database server by running the following script:

```
scripts\setup-test-databases.cmd
```

The environment variable `ACTIAN_TEST_CONNECTION_STRING` must be have a valid value for this to work.

The user that runs this script should:

- have permission to create new database users
- have permission to create new databases
- have permission to impersonate other database users

When running `scripts\setup-test-databases.cmd` the following users will be created:
- `"dbo"`
- `"db2"`
- `"db.2"`

### Running tests

These tests can be run in Visual Studio or from the command line:

```
dotnet test
```

The environment variable `ACTIAN_TEST_CONNECTION_STRING` must be have a valid value for this to work.
